# Challenge

Today our customers need to know how much it costs to anticipate a transaction, and for this, we need to develop an anticipation calculator so that they can know what amounts they will receive if they choose to anticipate the receipt

### Requirements

- Components
- Receipt periods must be configurable as the API can receive a list of periods to perform calculations.
